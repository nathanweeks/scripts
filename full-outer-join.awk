# NAME
#     full-outer-join.awk - perform a full outer join on tabular files
#
# SYNOPSIS 
#     full-outer-join.awk [HEADER=1] [SORT_OPTIONS=sort_options] FILE...
#
# DESCRIPTION
#     Perform a full outer join on the first field of two or more delimited
#     (default: tab) text files.
#
# OPERANDS
#     FILE
#         A delimited (default: tab) text file with 1 header line. The first
#         field of each record will be used as the the join field, must be
#         unique within each file, and needn't be sorted.
#
#         The field separator (delimiter) can be changed by adding an
#         FS="DELIMITER" operand before FILE. The new field separator will be
#         in effect for the remaining files, or until changed.
#
#     HEADER
#         Set to "1" (or any non-zero, non-blank value) if the first row is a
#         header.
#
#     SORT_OPTIONS
#         Options to pass to the "sort" command. By default, "-k 1,1" is used
#         to sorted output lexically on the first (join) field. Specify, e.g.,
#         "-k 1n,1n" to sort output numerically on the join field.
#
# STDIN
#     Standard input will be used only if no file operands are specified, or
#     if a file operand is '-'.
#
# STDOUT
#     A full outer join on the input files, with any headers printed in the
#     order in which they appear in the input files. The join field will be
#     output only once. Null values are printed as "NULL". By default, fields
#     are separated by a tab.
#
# STDERR
#     An error message will be printed to standard error, and the program will
#     terminate with a non-zero exit status, if one of the following occurs:
#
#     1. The number of input files is 1.
#     2. A duplicate join field value in the same input file is detected.
#     3. The number of fields in a record is inconsistent.
#
# EXAMPLES
#     1. Join 3 tab-delimited text files containing a header:
#
#        $ cat file1.txt
#        join_field	column1	column2
#        XYZ	c11	c12
#        ABC	c21	c22
#        GOP	c31	c32
#        $ cat file2.txt
#        join_field	column3	column4
#        GOP	c33	c34
#        XYZ	c13	c14
#        BOG	c43	c44
#        $ cat file3.txt
#        join_field	column5	column6
#        XYZ	c15	c16
#        GOP	c35	c36
#        BOG	c45	c46
#        $ full-outer-join.awk HEADER=1 file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
#        join_field	column1	column2	column3	column4	column5	column6
#        ABC	c21	c22	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL
#        BOG	NULL	NULL	c43	c44	c45	c46
#        GOP	c31	c32	c33	c34	c35	c36
#        XYZ	c11	c12	c13	c14	c15	c16
#
#    2. Join 3 comma-delimited text files that have "old Mac" newlines (i.e.,
#       carriage return instead of line feed) as is exported by Excel for Mac:
#       $ full-outer-join.awk FS="," RS="\r" HEADER=1 file[123].txt
#       ...
#
#    3. Join tab-delimited files containing SNPs on the same chromosome from
#       three different samples, where the file format is
#       POSITION REFERENCE_BASE SNP_BASE
#       Output is sorted numerically by position. A shell supporting process
#       substitution (such as bash, ksh, or zsh) is assumed.
#
#       $ cat sample1.snp
#       100	A	C
#       200	T	G
#       300	G	T
#       $ cat sample2.snp
#       100	A	C
#       250	T	G
#       300	G	T
#       $ cat sample3.snp
#       100	A	C
#       275	T	G
#       300	G	A
#       $ full-outer-join.awk <(cut -f 1,2 sample[123].snp | sort -u) \
#                             <(cut -f 1,3 sample1.snp) \
#                             <(cut -f 1,3 sample2.snp) \
#                             <(cut -f 1,3 sample3.snp) | sort -k 1n,1n
#       100	A	C	C	C
#       200	T	G	NULL	NULL
#       250	T	NULL	G	NULL
#       275	T	NULL	NULL	G
#       300	G	T	T	A
#      
# CHANGE HISTORY
#     2013-01-29    Bug fixes for changes in 2013-01-28 version.
#     2013-01-28    Make the header row optional, disabled by default and 
#                   enabled by the "HEADER=1" operand. Add a SORT_OPTIONS
#                   operand, which is useful when "HEADER=1" and, e.g.,
#                   the join field is to be sorted numerically instead of
#                   lexically.
#     2012-11-02    Basic error checking.
#     2012-11-01    Initial version
#
# BUGS
#     Minimal error checking is done on the input.
